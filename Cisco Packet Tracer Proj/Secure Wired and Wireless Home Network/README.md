In this project, I designed and simulated a small home network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network includes wired and wireless devices such as PCs and a laptop connected through a switch, router, and access point.

The router was configured as the default gateway and DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to all devices.
An access point was used to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless devices.

Network connectivity was tested using ping commands to verify communication between devices and internet simulation through the cloud.


Add this as “What I Configured” section
• Configured router LAN and WAN interfaces
• Set the router as the default gateway
• Configured DHCP using CLI to assign IP addresses automatically
• Connected wired devices through a switch
• Configured an access point to provide wireless connectivity
• Connected a laptop to the Wi-Fi network
• Verified network connectivity using ping

Network connectivity was tested by pinging the default gateway and external network (cloud) from both wired and wireless devices to ensure proper routing and IP assignment.
