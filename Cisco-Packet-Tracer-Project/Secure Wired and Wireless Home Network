In this project, I designed and simulated a small home network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network includes wired and wireless devices such as PCs and a laptop connected through a switch, router, and access point.

The router was configured as the default gateway and DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to all devices.
An access point was used to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless devices.

Network connectivity was tested using ping commands to verify communication between devices and internet simulation through the cloud.
