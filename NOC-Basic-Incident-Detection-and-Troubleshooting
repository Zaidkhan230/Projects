Basic NOC Incident Detection and Troubleshooting

Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world Network Operations Center (NOC) Level-1 incident. The objective is to understand how NOC teams detect issues, perform basic troubleshooting, and document incidents in a structured manner.

Scenario
Users reported that a service or application was not working properly. The task was to identify the issue type, perform troubleshooting steps, and document the findings.

Tools Used
- Windows Operating System
- Command Prompt (ping, nslookup)
- Task Manager
- Windows Services Manager (services.msc)

Troubleshooting Process
1. Verified network connectivity using ping
2. Checked DNS resolution using nslookup
3. Monitored system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
4. Checked service status using Windows Services Manager
5. Identified service-related issue and verified resolution steps

Incident Documentation
Issue: Service not accessible  
Detection: Simulated alert / user report  
Network Check: Connectivity and DNS verified  
System Check: CPU, memory, disk normal  
Root Cause: Service unavailability  
Status: Issue identified and documented  

Learning Outcome
- Understood monitoring vs troubleshooting
- Learned basic NOC incident handling workflow
- Practiced network, system, and service checks
- Gained experience in incident documentation
